# RaidSummon

## How it works:
You are in a RAID group

Someone types 123 in /ra or /s or /y

Playername gets added to the small RaidSummon frame and is synced accros all RaidSummon users

SHIFT + leftclick to move the frame

If a player is on the list the frame is visible (type /rs to show/hide it manually)

Left click to summon and remove (synced)

Control Left click to just target the player

Right click to remove (synced)


If no player is on the list the frame is hidden again (type /rs to show/hide it manually)


Options:

/rs help

/rs zone(enabled/disables zoneinfo in /w and /ra)

/rs whispers (enabled/disables whispering the target)


## 1.0.3 Updates:
Class Colors are now used in the List

Warlocks are always on top of the list
