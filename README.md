## Update on development
Due to Corona and the AQ Opening i dont have enough time to play and develop the Addon as much as i want. Thank you for your support.

## Usage
Raidmembers can type a special keyword in the raidchat (123, summon, sum or port)  
Their names will be added to the summon list and syned to all warlocks using the addon  
The name can be left clicked to target the raidmember  
CTRL+left click to remove a member from the list (synced - name will be removed from all addon users)  
Finally summon the member with right click and send a message to the raid / whisper (member will be removed from the list - synced)  
Drag the frame by holding SHIFT+left click

## Combat Lockdown
Due to Blizzard restrictions it is not possible to update the summon frame during combat, however after leaving combat it may take up to 10 seconds for the name to be displayed.
